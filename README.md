# Power BI Course Project Repository

This repository is dedicated to hosting my Power BI course project. The project is designed to address the following key points:

## Key Considerations
- Create a "Details" page as per the project challenge requirements.
- Consider the layout of visuals for optimal content consumption by the client.
- The number of pages may vary based on the arrangement of visuals; up to two pages may be included as needed.
- Create the necessary measures to enhance the data analysis.

## Possible Visuals for the Report
- Visualizations highlighting the TOP3 Products.
- Visualization of top countries in terms of sales and/or profit (or any other relevant field).
- Scatter plot depicting Units Sold vs. Sales by month.
- Data grouping visuals.
- Data segmentation visuals.


Happy data analysis and reporting!
